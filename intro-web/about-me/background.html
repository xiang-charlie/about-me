                    This is me! I was born on December 20th, 2000, in a snowy town in Japan called Kanazawa. Since this picture 
                    was taken on August 25th, 2003, that means that I was three and a half years old in this picture! I'm not 
                    quite sure what I was looking at here, but this is one of the few pictures that I have of myself, at that 
                    age, in a dress. I absolutely detested dresses and "girly" things when I was little, so I'm sure my parents 
                    had to bribe me somehow to wrangle me into that outfit!
                </p>
                <img src="pictures/background/baby-blue-jacket.jpeg" srcset="pictures/background/baby-blue-jacket.png, pictures/background/baby-blue-jacket-cropped.png" alt="Baby me with blue jacket" width="320" height="240"/>
                <p>
                    Case in point! This picture of me is from a little earlier that same summer, but the outfit is a lot more 
                    like something that I would have typically worn back then. It's not super "tomboy-ish", but I was crazy about 
                    the color blue, so I don't think I minded. Again, I'm not sure what I'm looking at...baby me seems to have 
                    been quite a headache in terms of posing for photos (in the sense that I didn't pose at all).

                <p>
                    Last picture of me as a baby! I'm about to turn four in this picture, and we were out sledding that day since 
                    had just snowed a bunch the night before. I couldn't find it, but there is a picture floating around 
                    somewhere, of me that day carrying a family-sized bag of Bugles half the size of me - so that's what I'm 
                    eating (and, I suspect, why I look so content). And I finally learned how to look into the camera!

                    This is a fairly large jump, but I had a lot of trouble finding pictures of me in elementary school, so! 
                    I stopped taking pictures of myself starting in middle school; I didn't really go out too often, and when I 
                    did I usually preferred to put my phone away and just enjoy the time, or else I would only take pictures of 
                    other people, or scenery. Part of it was totally because I didn't like how awkward I looked! I had my braces 
                    all the way until the end of my Sophomore year of high school, which really blows. I did have my moments 
                    though. Here's a picture of me laughing along as a friend of mine told a joke! (I did crop her out though, 
                    sorry Vicka.)

                    Another pretty big time skip, I know, but here's me at prom! I bought my dress for a hundred dollars at my 
                    local Macy's, the weekend before prom. Bad planning on my part, but everything worked out and I really liked 
                    the dress that I ended up getting! Technically it is a two-piece dress, which might not technically qualify 
                    as a dress since it's more of a top-and-skirt combo, but potato po-tah-to. My favorite part of it was that 
                    it had pockets! The most annoying thing about wearing a dress usually is that, even if you're not really 
                    carrying anything in your hands, you still have nowhere to put your phone - so this was a life saver. My 
                    heels really did end up hurting my feet though, but I guess that's my fault since I did buy them a half-size 
                    too large.

                <p>
                    Finally, here's me in New York City! I was super lucky, since NYU was my top choice of University. I was 
                    super introverted and kept to myself a lot during high school, and to some extent I'm still quite similar 
                    here, but I'm grateful to have found a group of friends that like me for who I am. In this picture I'm 
                    with my friend Austin; I had just gotten my new sweater, which I'm wearing, and I was feeling really great 
                    that day. I hope we get to go out like that again soon!
                </p>
                <p>
                    And that's me! A short timeline of me from age 3-19. I'd have liked to share even more pictures, but as it 
                    is I already had a hard enough time limiting the pictures I wanted to share! Maybe I'll come back here and 
                    add more to this at some point, and make things look prettier.
